title: Face Recognition System
published: true
---

This is a brief introduction for a project, "Face Recognition Systems Based on Sparse Representation", funded by Beijing University Students' Scientific Research and Entrepreneurship Action Plan.


The system consisted of three modules: face detection using the Haar classifier, face recognition based on Sparse Representation algorithm, and a database system based on Structured Query Language.

The system was developed by Python and OpenCV, as well as a set of Python tools such as numpy, cvxopt and wxPython to solve computational problems and design the graphical user interface. 

With the help of Sparse Presentation, we achieved success in developing face recognition with an accuracy of more than 90%, even retained this accuracy in low lighting conditions or when a face was partially obstructed, like when someone was wearing sunglasses.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
