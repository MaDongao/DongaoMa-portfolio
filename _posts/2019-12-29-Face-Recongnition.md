This is a brief introduction for a project, "Face Recognition Systems Based on Sparse Representation", funded by Beijing University Students' Scientific Research and Entrepreneurship Action Plan in 2014.


The system consisted of three modules: face detection using the Haar classifier, face recognition based on Sparse Representation algorithm, and a database system based on Structured Query Language.

The system was developed by Python and OpenCV, as well as a set of Python tools such as numpy, cvxopt and wxPython to solve computational problems and design the graphical user interface. 

With the help of Sparse Presentation, we achieved success in developing face recognition with an accuracy of more than 90%, even retained this accuracy in low lighting conditions or when a face was partially obstructed, like when someone was wearing sunglasses.
