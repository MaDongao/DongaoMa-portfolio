# [](#header-1)Binocular Visual Target Tracking

This is a brief introduction for a project,“Binocular Vision Target Tracking System for Network Camera Based on CMT Algorithms”, funded by National College Student Innovation Training Program in 2015. 

We realized the “Selection-Recognition-Tracking” module in static mode, implemented the dynamic tracking on the adjustable network surveillance camera, and finally completed the communication and coordinated tracking between the binocular cameras.
