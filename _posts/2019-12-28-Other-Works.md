# [](#header-2)Binocular Visual Target Tracking

This is a brief introduction for a project,“Binocular Vision Target Tracking System for Network Camera Based on CMT Algorithms”, funded by National College Student Innovation Training Program in 2015. 

We realized the “Selection-Recognition-Tracking” module in static mode, implemented the dynamic tracking on the adjustable network surveillance camera, and finally completed the communication and coordinated tracking between the binocular cameras.

There were many other works I developed at my undergraduate school, such as various systems developed by Java and website systems developed by PHP or J2EE framework. But unfortunately, the demos were lost or not recorded.
